	<p style=" font-size: 30px;margin: 50px;">With the cooperation of Greater Noida Police and IIMT Group of Colleges, Nukkad Nataks were enacted to spread awareness about the woman empowerment at the different places of Greater Noida-NCR. Through the Nukkad Nataks, IIMTians (the Students of IIMT) drew the attention of the people towards violence inflicted upon women. In the play, it is shown that the women themselves should raise voice against the violence inflicted upon them. If the women show courage and come forward to oppose it, the police administration is always ready to help them and uproot the violence against them. Through the play, the attention was also drawn towards the social vices like female feticide, dowry torture, domestic violence, child marriage etc.<br><br>Through Nukkad Natak, an attempt was made to find out solution of these problems. An emphasis was made upon the girl-child education. The IIMTians also made the people aware about the violence against woman at Pari Chowk, Dadri, GIP Mall Noida through the Natak. SP, Dehat Ms Suniti upheld that the moto of the police is to make the women aware of the violence against them through such kinds of nukkad natak.
