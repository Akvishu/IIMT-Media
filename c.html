		It is said that the mind of students that are on “Balanced Diet” can perform their best. With this in mind, the students of IIMT are on balanced diet regime which is maintained by the unique mess in the campus wherein variety of Indian, Chinese & Continental meals and snacks are served to the multi ethnic taste of the students.  All the cafes within the campus serve Quality food and maintain the highest level of Hygiene. <br> 

There are 6 active cafeterias that ensure the above for the busy minds. Both students and the faculty members are provided food and snacks at subsidized rates.
